# ðŸ“Š Google Play Store Apps - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on **analyzing apps listed on the Google Play Store** using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
The dataset (`googleplaystore_v2.csv`) provides detailed attributes such as app ratings, installs, reviews, categories, content ratings, and pricing.  
The aim was to uncover patterns and trends that explain **user behavior, app distribution, and performance metrics**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- **Dataset:** `googleplaystore_v2.csv` (googleplaystore_v2.csv) 
- **Jupyter Notebook:** `Google Playstore-Case Study.ipynb`  
- **Report (PDF):** `Google_Play_Store_Report.pdf`

## ðŸ›  Approach
The analysis was carried out step by step in a structured manner:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Removed junk and duplicate records  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Corrected data types (e.g., numerical conversions)  
   - Detected and removed outliers  

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histogram of ratings â†’ observed skewness towards higher ratings  
   - Bar chart of content ratings â†’ found **â€˜Everyoneâ€™** category dominates  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Scatter plot (App Size vs. Rating) â†’ weak trend, medium-sized apps perform better  
   - Regression plots â†’ explored subtle correlations between variables  

4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Pair plots â†’ insights on relationships:
     - Price & Rating â†’ very weak correlation  
     - Reviews & Price â†’ mostly inversely related  
   - Box plots & bar plots (by Content Rating) â†’ highlighted spread of ratings across categories  

5. **Advanced Insights**
   - Heatmap of Ratings vs. Reviews vs. Content Ratings â†’ identified user preference clusters  
   - Category-wise install distribution â†’ Games, Family, Tools dominate in count, while Communication & Social apps dominate in installs

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
1. **App Ratings:** Most apps maintain a strong rating between **4.0â€“4.5**, showing positive user satisfaction.  
2. **App Categories:** *Family, Games, and Tools* dominate in volume; *Social & Communication* apps lead in installs.  
3. **Pricing Strategy:** ~92% of apps are **free**, reflecting a freemium-driven ecosystem.  
4. **Paid Apps:** Attract fewer installs; pricing does **not directly boost ratings**.  
5. **App Size:** Medium-sized apps (**10â€“50MB**) perform best in installs & ratings.  
6. **User Reviews:** Generally, more reviews = higher ratings, with some outliers.  
7. **Install Distribution:** Right-skewed; most apps between **1,000â€“100,000 installs**, very few cross **1B installs**.  
8. **Content Rating:** **â€˜Everyoneâ€™** dominates, reflecting mass adoption of general-use apps.  
9. **Gaming Apps:** Arcade, Casual, and Action games lead the space; niche genres have smaller but loyal bases.  
10. **Top Performers:** Apps like **WhatsApp, YouTube, and Google services** dominate installs and ratings â†’ showing their indispensability.
